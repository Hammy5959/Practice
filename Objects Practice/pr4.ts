`Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should
 always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of
  keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value 
  pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object that’s returned to make sure
   all the information was stored correctly.`;
